# hey, i’m Cogito 👋

i break things, fix some, and pretend to know what i’m doing.

- 🕹️ mostly into games, code, and snacks
- 📚 occasionally try to study stuff i’ll forget tomorrow
- 💡 currently learning: Rust, Docker, shaders & other cool stuff
- 🎯 goals: build cool sh.., stay sane

> dm me if you wanna build something dumb but fun.
